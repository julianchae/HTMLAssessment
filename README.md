#### Description
We were to best recreate a webpage with sports statistics of the Denver Broncos and Chicago Bears.

#### Lessons Learned
I got a better grasp on HTML. While pretty ugly, the task was completed and HTML was solidified in my head.

#### Technologies Used
Atom and HTML.
We used tables, lists, imported images, referenced links, submitions, check boxes, and radio buttons.


#### What Was Fun

Setting up our own webpage was fun, I believe it is a bit of foreshadowing of what is up next! I am excited to move on to more front end of web development.
